Seedit was an Android application designed for [Citrus's Mobile App Challenge](http://mobileappchallenge.org/) .
The idea behind Seedit was to make a tool that simplifified gardening and make it accessible to a
wider demographic. The app has now been deprecated due to other projects that I am undertaking as
well as the fact that Parse is no longer supported. Feel free to fork this project if this concept
is interesting to you and make changes to the design or function of this application.

You can learn more about the application here at http://getseedit.herokuapp.com/.
